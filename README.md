Popular Movies app Stage 1

An API key is needed from www.themoviedb.org.
Create an account and request an API key from www.themoviedb.org and add it to the following line in the gradle.properties file

PopularMovies_themoviedbkey=""

For example, if your API key is "ABC123", it will look like this:

PopularMovies_themoviedbkey="ABC123"

I used this article https://medium.com/code-better/hiding-api-keys-from-your-android-repository-b23f5598b906, to make sure that the 
API key was hidden and then also deleted it from gradle.properties before uploading the code to be reviewed.
